# Audio Features for Continued Vowel A

This folder contains precalculated audio features for the Continued Vowel A audio recordings. These features provide valuable insights into the acoustic characteristics of the recorded speech. Here's an explanation of the calculated features:

1. **Formants**: Formants are the resonant frequencies of the vocal tract. They are essential for speech analysis and often used in speaker recognition and speech synthesis.
2. **Antiformants**: Antiformants are frequencies at which there is a local minimum in the spectral envelope. They can provide information about vocal tract shape and filter characteristics.
3. **Fo (Fundamental Frequency)**: Fo represents the fundamental frequency of the voice, which corresponds to the pitch of the voice.
4. **To (Pitch Period)**: To is the duration of one pitch period, which can be useful for analyzing speech prosody and pitch variations.
5. **HNR (Harmonic-to-Noise Ratio)**: HNR measures the ratio of harmonic components to noise in the voice signal, providing information about voice quality.
6. **CHNR (Cepstral HNR)**: A variation of HNR, computed in the cepstral domain, often used for voice analysis.
7. **NHE (Normalized Horizontal Energy)**: NHE is a measure of energy concentration in the horizontal direction, often used for characterizing speech segments.
8. **GNE (Glottal-to-Noise Excitation)**: GNE measures the excitation of the glottal source in voice production.
9. **Jitter**: Jitter measures the cycle-to-cycle variations in pitch, which can be an indicator of voice disorders or instability.
10. **Rap (Relative Average Perturbation)**: Similar to jitter, Rap quantifies variations in pitch and is used in voice analysis.
11. **PPQ (Pitch Period Perturbation Quotient)**: PPQ is another measure of pitch variations and can be useful for detecting voice disorders.
12. **SPPQ (Smoothed Pitch Period Perturbation Quotient)**: SPPQ is a smoothed version of PPQ, providing a more stable measure of pitch perturbation.
13. **SHDB (Shimmer in dB)**: Shimmer quantifies amplitude variations in speech, which can be indicative of voice quality and stability.
14. **APQ (Amplitude Perturbation Quotient)**: APQ is a measure of amplitude variations in speech, similar to shimmer.
15. **FFTR (Fast Fourier Transform Ratio)**: FFTR represents the ratio of the energy in low-frequency components to high-frequency components and can offer insights into speech quality.
16. **FTRI (Formant Triangularity Index)**: FTRI measures the triangularity of the formant structure and can provide information about the speech source-filter interaction.
17. **FATR (Formant Amplitude Tracking Ratio)**: FATR quantifies the stability of formant frequencies during speech.
18. **ATRI (Amplitude Tracking Ratio Index)**: ATRI measures the stability of amplitude changes in the speech signal.

These audio features are essential for various applications in speech processing, including speaker recognition, emotion recognition, and voice quality assessment. They provide a comprehensive understanding of the acoustic properties of Continued Vowel A recordings and can be used for further analysis and research.
