# Clinical Data

This folder contains clinical data collected during patients' visits to the hospital at different time points: 2 weeks before surgery (2wbs), 2 weeks after surgery (2was), and 3 months after surgery (3mas). Each visit is represented by a separate CSV file, and here's an overview of the data included:

1. **Date**: The date of the patient's hospital visit.
2. **Weight**: The patient's weight at the time of the visit, if measured.
3. **Nasality Test**: The results of a nasality test, which may be used to assess speech disorders or changes in nasality.
4. **Nasometry**: Data related to nasometry, which measures the degree of nasality in speech. Nasometry data can help analyze speech changes over time.
5. **Doctor Comments**: Any comments, notes, or observations made by the attending doctor during the visit.
6. **GRABS Values**: Data related to the GRABS assessment. GRABS stands for "Grade, Roughness, Breathiness, Asthenia, Strain," and it is used to evaluate voice quality.
7. **Audio Path**: The path to the corresponding audio recording that matches the clinical data for that specific visit.

The clinical data is structured into three separate CSV files, one for each visit to the hospital. This organization allows for clear differentiation and analysis of patient data at different time intervals.

Please refer to the respective CSV file for each visit to access detailed information related to that specific hospital visit. The associated audio recordings can be used in conjunction with the clinical data for comprehensive analysis and research.

We hope this clinical data proves valuable for your research and healthcare initiatives.
