## audio_comments.csv

`audio_comments.csv` is a collection of free-text doctor's comments in Spanish. These comments are specific to each audio recording for each patient. The comments are not translated to ensure that the doctor's intended meaning is preserved. Each comment may contain valuable insights into the patient's condition, diagnosis, and other relevant medical information. These comments can provide context and additional details that are crucial for a comprehensive understanding of the audio recordings.
