# Audio Recordings

This folder contains a diverse collection of audio recordings for various surgeries and speech contexts. Below is an explanation of the different types of audio recordings available:

## Surgery Categories

1. **Vowels (a, e, i, o, u)**: Audio recordings of individual vowel sounds, which are commonly used in phonetic analysis and speech research.
2. **Continued Vowel A (a1, a2, a3)**: These are the recordings of the vowel "A" continued over time, captured at three different instances: a1, a2, and a3.
3. **"AEIOU" Pronunciation**: An audio recording in which the speaker enunciates the sequence of vowels "AEIOU," which can be used for articulation analysis.
4. **TDU - "Agua"**: A recording of Text Dependant Utterance (TDU) pronunciation, where the speaker utters a Spanish popular phrase related to "agua" (water).
5. **TDU - "Brasero"**: Another TDU recording, this time saying a phrase related to "brasero."
6. **TDU - "Día"**: A TDU recording of a phrase associated with "día" (day).
7. **TDU - "Mesa"**: A TDU recording of a phrase related to "mesa" (table).
8. **Free Monologue Speech**: A recording of spontaneous and unscripted speech, often used for studying natural language use and fluency.
9. **Concatenated Reading**: An audio recording where different passages or texts are concatenated, which can be be useful for analyzing prosody and continuity.
10. **"Un" Pronunciation**: An audio recording in which the speaker says the word "un," which is often used in linguistic and phonetic analysis.

These audio recordings offer a rich resource for various speech and language studies, including phonetics, prosody, phonology, and more. Researchers can use these recordings for experiments, analysis, and understanding the nuances of speech and language production.
